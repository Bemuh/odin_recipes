    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p></p>
        <p>This is a quick, easy, and authentic Thai curry dish that's sweet and very spicy. 
        I became addicted to the dish at a local restaurant and then worked to duplicate it at home. 
        I think I've got the taste and presentation pegged. I'm guesstimating on the amounts since I don't measure much when I cook. 
        Feel free to adjust to taste.</p>
